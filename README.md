## abstract
Repository for  prototype framework, designed for modelling structure of real world objects in graph representation

## roadmap
Development roadmap include next goals:

* Python prototype
    - define API with abstract classes
    - complete classes which will doing things 
    - write optimization module for generating object structure via existing in graph representation
    - write function  for assess of structure's symantic possibility
    - write function for assess efficient of structure
* C++ prototype
    - write C-extension for the most resource-intensive modules

... In progress
